##Description
Multiple choice quiz application assessing a user's skills by asking multiple choice questions that give the user the option to select only one answer per question within a given period of time. Questions can be reloaded whenever necessary. There are a total of five multiple-choice questions. However, for now, the app only features multiple-choice questions. The user's answer becomes final and cannot be retracted once he selects his answer and clicks the submit button.
